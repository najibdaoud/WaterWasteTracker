# WaterWasteTracker

## Description
The Water Waste Tracker is an IOT system that tracks the amount of water waster using LEGO Education products to gather the data and Onshape to display the data. To gather data, two sensors are attached to a water faucet to track when the water is running and when there is an object below the faucet. The LEGO EV3 processes the data and sends the percentage of water wasted (water in-use runtime / total water runtime) to Onshape, which displays this data in a 3D format.
